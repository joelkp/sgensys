mgensys will read a script file and produce audio output; once more developed
writing to audio files will be implemented.

Script syntax:

Whitespace is not allowed within names that come after the initial letter of
an operation, such as sin, tri. Nor is it allowed within numbers. Apart from
this, spaces and tabs may be freely placed, or - not recommended - omitted.

Newlines terminate steps, though a new step will also terminate the previous
one allowing multiple steps on one line.

< and > allow nesting of scope; the step prior to the < remains in scope
until new steps are given, and a newline or a > will return to the step for
which the < was given.

* Operations consist of a name followed by optional arguments for parameters.
* Arguments are given for an operation.
* Operators affect operations much like arguments, but may be more freely
  placed and do not belong to the present operation.

Operations will output audio at the same time unless time shifts/delays are
involved. Each delaying will delay (shift the time of) all future operations.

The following operations are supported:

S:
	Set default values for parameters f, t, a, \.

Wsin, Wsqr, Wtri, Wsaw:
	Play sine, square, triangle or saw wave.
	Supports f, t, a, \ parameters.

The following parameters can be found in operations:
	f	Frequency in Hz.
	t	Time in seconds.
	a	Amplitude, where 1.0 is full-range.
	\	Time shift/delay current operation and following ones, time
		in seconds.

The following operators are supported:

/:	Time shift/delay next operation and following ones, time in seconds.
E:	Add time shift/delay independent of / so that the next operation
	begins at the end of that which preceeds it, though / and \ may
	further delay it.

Any W operation may be prefixed by "'label " in order to define a label for
it, where label is anything followed by whitespace; thereafter the label may
be referenced as ":label", allowing future changes to an operation
previously defined. For practical purposes, label referencing can be
considered an operation, behaving the same.
