sgensys is the Sound/scriptable GENeration SYStem, a sound synthesis program
developed for musical purposes; it will read a script file and produce audio
output; once more developed writing to audio files will be implemented.

Script syntax:

Whitespace is not allowed within names that come after the initial letter of
an operation, such as sin, tri. Nor is it allowed within numbers. Apart from
this, spaces and tabs may be freely placed, or - not recommended - omitted.

Newlines terminate steps, though a new step will also terminate the previous
one allowing multiple steps on one line.

< and > allow nesting of scope; the step prior to the < remains in scope
until new steps are given, and a newline or a > will return to the step for
which the < was given.

Parameters with nesting use { and } instead, differentiating the two, though
such nesting also allows newlines.

When a number is given for a parameter, specifying it within parentheses will
make the syntax freer, allowing mathematical operations and further nesting of
parentheses. Whitespace including newlines may be freely placed until the
final closing parenthesis.

* Operations consist of a name followed by optional arguments for parameters.
* Arguments are given for an operation.
* Operators affect operations much like arguments, but may be more freely
  placed and do not belong to the present operation.

Operations will output audio at the same time unless time shifts/delays are
involved. Each delaying will delay (shift the time of) all future operations.

The following operations are supported:

S:
	f, r, t	Set default values for parameters f (default 100),
		r (default 1), t (default 1).
	a	Sets a multiplier for the amplitude for all non-modulator
		waves; effectively a volume control for the combined output.

Wsin, Wsqr, Wtri, Wsaw:
	Play sine, square, triangle or saw wave.
	Supports f, t, a, \ parameters.

The following parameters can be found in wave operations:
	t	Time duration in seconds. If no t setting given, default time
		depends on context - either scaling to fit the duration of
		play until the end of the current group of sounds, or the
		default value if alone.
	f	Frequency in Hz.
	f!{}	Second frequency in Hz to modulate (FM) to by wave or envelope,
		and/or a list of modulators given within {} following the
		number if given.
	r	Frequency ratio (modulator waves only) of carrier to modulator.
		Keeps frequency that of that of the carrier divided by the
		given. Often used in the form r(n/m) to give an n:m ratio.
	r!{}	Second frequency ratio (modulator waves only) to modulate (FM)
		to by wave or envelope, and/or a list of modulators given
		within {} following the number if given.
	a	Amplitude, where 1.0 gives a level of 0dB, which is the signal
		max of the output. For a modulator wave, this however simply
		adjusts the effect strength.
	a!{}	Second amplitude to modulate (AM) to by wave or envelope,
		and/or a list of modulators given within {} following the
		number if given.
	p	Set the beginning phase of the wave. For example, p(3/4) will
		make a sine or triangle wave begin at its "bottom". This is
		mostly used where wanted for waves used by f!/r! or a!.
	p!{}	A list of modulator (PM) waves is given within the {}, the
		per-sample sum of which is used to phase-modulate the carrier,
		be it the final carrier or in turn another modulator.
	\	Time shift/delay current operation and following ones, time
		in seconds.

The following operators are supported:

/:	Time shift/delay next operation and following ones, time in seconds.
	Alternatively, /t will delay by the time of the previous operation.
|:	Add (independently of /) enough time shift/delay for the next operation
	to begin at the end of all that preceeds it, though / and \ may
	further delay it.

Any W operation may be prefixed by "'label " in order to define a label for
it, where label is anything followed by whitespace; thereafter the label may
be referenced as ":label", allowing future changes to an operation
previously defined. For practical purposes, label referencing can be
considered an operation, behaving the same.
